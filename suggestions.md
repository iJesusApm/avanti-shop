## Potential Changes and Improvements

While working on the task, I have identified a few potential changes and improvements that could be made to enhance the application:

- Improve state management/: Implement a pattern or tools to improve or manage a global state in the application, in order to avoid multiple calls to the service when verifying some API. Example: Redux, react-query, mobx.

- Code Refactoring/: Analyze the existing code base and identify opportunities for refactoring. This can include improving code organization, removing duplicate code, and optimizing performance.

- Performance Optimization/: Identify areas where the application can be optimized for better performance. This can include reducing unnecessary network requests, optimizing image loading, and implementing lazy loading for data.

- Performance Monitoring/: Set up performance monitoring tools to track and analyze application performance in real-time. This will help identify and address performance bottlenecks and ensure optimal user experience.

- Code Documentation/: Enhance code documentation by providing clear and concise comments and documenting important functions, classes, and modules. This will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers.

- Unit Testing/: Increase unit test coverage by writing unit tests for critical components and functionality. This will help ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

- Error Handling/: Implement error handling functionality throughout the application. This includes handling network errors, invalid data, and other potential issues to provide a smooth user experience.

- Accessibility/: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices for accessibility. This includes using proper labels, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring proper keyboard navigation.

- Internationalization/: Implement support for multiple languages and regions to make the application accessible to a wider audience. This involves extracting all user-facing text into language files and providing translations.
